## Reflections

### Module 1.

After completing this module I understood position of TS relative to JS and learnt how to install TS. Learning of TS will enhance my development skills.

### Module 2.

After completing this module I understood how it could be helpful to declare variables in TS using primitive, object, union and intersection types. I understood that TS's static type system allows to describe the shape of objects, provide better documentation, and verify that your code works correctly before compiling it.

### Module 3.

After completing this module I understood reasons for using interfaces in TS, tryed to declare and implement interfaces. In TS interfaces can be used in the same way as in traditional OOP.

### Module 4.

After completing this module I learnt how to define functions with arguments and returning types, and wrote some functions with them. TS adds a number of new features to standard JS functions that make them easier to work with.

### Module 5.

After completing this module I understood how to declare a class in TS, tryed to understand how to extend classes, use access modifiers and so on. One of the benefits of TS is that you can use it to develop with classes, and then optionally compile the result into JS code that runs in all major browsers and on all common platforms.

### Module 6.

After completing this module I tryed to understand how generics works. I tryed to declare and implement generics. Generics are code patterns that can be defined and used in a code base. They provide a way to tell functions, classes, or interfaces what type you want them to be when called.

### Module 7.

After completing this module I understood how optimize and organize code using modules and how to import an external type library. Modules provide a way to organize and categorize code, allowing related code to be grouped together.

### Module 8.

After completing this module I understood what namespaces are, whats their main purpose and tryed to implement some namespaces. Namespaces allow you to group variables, functions, interfaces, or classes associated with business rules in one namespace and security in another.
