Hello everyone and welcome to my self-presentation. Today you will get to know this handsome guy just a little bit better. Sit back, fasten your seatbelts, and let's get started!

My name is Sergey Tsepodoy, I’m 33 years old. I’m from Petropavlovsk called “North Gate of Kazakhstan”. A long long time ago in 2012, I graduated from North Kazakhstan State University with a bachelor degree in computer science. WHOOSH and I am a certified computer science teacher.

I have been interested in programming since school, where I was the best student in our programming club. In that period I learned the basics of programming with BASIC and turbo pascal.

I deliberately entered computer science because I always loved computers and computer games. This is a whole beautiful world in which you can hide from the harsh grey reality.

At university I focused heavily on studying web programming. I learned HTML, CSS (it was still version 2.1, if I'm not mistaken), PHP and Javascript. During my studies, I wrote about 3-4 websites of different directions, for example, fan-site about Metallica rock group.

My graduation project was a multimedia web application for preparing for exams in biology. As it is now fashionable to say, it was a full-stack application, with a backend in PHP and a frontend in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Fate decreed that I never worked in IT, but one way or another my entire career path is closely connected with IT. I spent 7 years in the civil service, where I came a long way from an ordinary "computer specialist" to the head of the information and IT control department.

After that, I went to work in telecommunications, and now I am the director of the regional branch of one of the companies.

It seems that everything in my life is so good, both the position and salary. But my soul still wants to go back to IT. I started thinking about returning to IT last summer. The frontend was chosen immediately because... this is what I was already more or less familiar with.

So I found a JavaScript course on Udemy from Jonas Schmedtman. He is absolutely great! He explains the basics really well.

Then I learned about the RS School course from the EPAM newsletter. In the fall, I signed up for RS School frontend course stage 1, bypassing level zero.

Well, this is not a cakewalk for me. Absolutely every task was difficult to me. Bot I solved them all. At this time.

I have a great motivation to study further. If you allow me to joke, I do this for two reasons:

1. Because my wife wants to become my "kept woman".
2. Because I want to drink only elite alcohol.

Seriously speaking, in fact, after the Covid restrictions, I had a need for a job that would not tie me to my place of life. Moreover, I love to travel, and working in IT can help me fulfill this dream.

I am a very versatile person. My level of English is not good enough, despite the fact that according to the EPAM training portal it is B2. But still, I understand that I need a lot more practice to be confident in my English.

There is almost no free time now, but in those ancient times, when I had free time, I like to play computer games, play guitar, play the handpan. I love football, auto and motorcycle racing, especially Formula 1 and MotoGP. If you would like to discuss this, you can add me on LinkedIn or Telegram.

But to be honest, as you can understand from the self-presentation, I have already changed areas of activity several times, and each time I achieved good results. So I stay calm and go towards my goal - to become an excellent front-end specialist and write a lot of good, beautiful, clean code.

Thank you for watching to the end. If you liked this handsome guy and the way he talked about himself, you can like it, I will be pleased.
