# Transcription

Hello everyone and welcome to my presentation. Today we would be
digging deeper into understanding what IoT is and how web
development and IoT devices go hand in hand. To explain what
Internet of Things or IOT is, let's dream a little bit.

Imagine you're at work and realize that you might not have turned
off the air conditioner while leaving your house. What a terrible situation!

But don't panic! IoT can save you!

Instead of of running all the way home and leaving the workplace
you could use your smartphone to get the status of your air conditioner and simply
turn it off! How amazing, isn't it? My answer is Yes, and this is
the power of the Internet of Things.

Do you need more examples?
Your alarm clock has just rung, and the coffee machine has already started brewing your coffee
A smoke detector sensed the danger and immediately reported to the security company.
Smart bulbs take into account the level of light around them and adjust their own brightness.
