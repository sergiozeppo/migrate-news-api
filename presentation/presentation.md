Hello everyone and welcome to my presentation. Today we would be
digging deeper into understanding what IoT is and how web
development and IoT devices go hand in hand. To explain what
Internet of Things or IOT is, let's dream a little bit.

Imagine you're at work and realize that you might not have turned
off the air conditioner while leaving your house. What a terrible situation!

But don't panic! IoT can save you!

Instead of of running all the way home and leaving the workplace
you could use your smartphone to get the status of your air conditioner and simply
turn it off! How amazing, isn't it? My answer is Yes, and this is
the power of the Internet of Things.

Do you need more examples?
Your alarm clock has just rung, and the coffee machine has already started brewing your coffee
A smoke detector sensed the danger and immediately reported to the security company.
Smart bulbs take into account the level of light around them and adjust their own brightness.

Until recently, access to the Internet was limited via devices like
the desktop, tablet or smartphone. But now with IoT, practically all
appliances can be connected to the Internet and monitored remotely.

IoT - It is a system of interconnected devices that transfer and
exchange data over a wireless network without any human
intervention. The things in Internet of Things could be the AC,
mentioned earlier, doorbell, thermostats, smoke detectors, water
heaters and many other detectors, radiomodules and sensors.

The status of all these devices can be monitored via a web or
mobile app, reporting, management and scripting of
device-to-device interaction behavior. Some of the examples of
such scenarios I mentioned earlier.

From effective communication between devices to accurate processing
of the data received, a lot of components are involved. In the
context of IoT devices, hardware can be classified into general
devices and sensing devices. The general devices are the main
components of the data hub and information exchange. They are
connected either by wired or wireless interfaces. Home appliances
are a classic example of such devices.

The sensing devices, on the other hand, include sensors and
actuators. They measure the temperature, Humidity, light intensity
and other parameters. These IoT devices are connected to the
network with the help of gateways. These gateways, or processing
nodes, process the information collected from the sensors and
transfer it to the cloud. The cloud acts as both the storage and
processing unit.

Actions are performed on the collected data for further learning
and inferences. Wired and wireless interfaces like Wi-Fi,
Bluetooth, Zigbee, GSM and so on are used to provide connectivity.
To ensure its ubiquity, applications need to support a diverse set
of devices and communication protocols, from tiny sensors capable
of sensing and reporting the desired factor to powerful back end
servers that are utilized for data analysis and knowledge
extraction.

Let's suppose you want to water your garden every time the moisture
level in the soil drops. Instead of doing it manually, you could
automate it using IoT.The sensors and actuators installed gauge the
soil for its moisture. This information is sent to the IoT gateway
with the help of communication protocols like MQTT or HTTP.The
gateway significantly aggregates data and feeds it to the cloud with
the help of Wi-Fi LAN.

Once the moisture level drops, the system is immediately triggered
and the sprinklers are turned on. However, with the information
stored in the cloud, a detailed analysis like the time of the day
the sprinkler was turned on, the rate at which the moisture in the
soil reduces and so on can be done. In the report could be sent
over to you over Web-application or on your smartphone over an
app.

We've just covered the basics of IoT and learned how it works. Now I
suggest we dive into some advanced techniques, and look at working
IoT prototypes and web applications. I want to tell you about some
projects such as utility network monitoring, water body level
monitoring, soil monitoring, digital pasture.

All of the sensors you see on the screen are used to monitor
utilities. They can determine pressure levels, fluid temperatures,
humidity, air temperature, and monitoring of well manhole openings.

The signals from these sensors are transmitted through radio modules
to the cloud server. The web application you see on your screen
receives the data from the server. Reports and graphs are generated
from this data.

In these slides, you can see how the sensors for soil monitoring are
installed. They they can detect soil temperature, moisture and
conductivity at different depth levels.

And this is soil monitoring Web-application. As you can see, this
report from the Web Application measures soil temperature at four
different levels.

Last but not least is the digital farm. This is a project that
allows using IoT trackers to monitor the movement of animals,
primarily horses. An IoT tracker is worn around the horse's neck,
allowing data to be transmitted to the nearest mobile, satellite or
radio base station.

Today, IoT is being used extensively to lessen the burden on humans,
to name a few. Iots deployed for smart homes, wearables, watches and
bracelets, smart cars, smart farming, smart retail, smart grids,
smart city and smart healthcare. With such a wide spectrum of
applications, the future of it looks more promising than ever
before.

In 2018, therewere about 23 billion connected devices, which was
more than double the world population. According to experts, there
will be over 80 billion devices by 2025. Hence the conclusion is
that IoT is the concept of connecting all devices using the
Internet, which is constantly learning and constantly growing.

Now that you have a picture of what IoT is and how Web Development
is growing hand-in-hand. If you still have questions, please ask,
I'd be happy to answer them. In the meantime, it's time to say
goodbye!
